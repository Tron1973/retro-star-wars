The Jabba The Hutt playset was originally released for the Return Of The Jedi series of toys. Although it did not include any action figures, it did include Salacious Crumb. The Han Solo carbonite in the photo is actually from Boba Fett's Slave-1 vehicle set.

We still have the original box (pictured) and it is in ok condition.
