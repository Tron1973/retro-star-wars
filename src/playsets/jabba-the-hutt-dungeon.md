The Jabba The Hutt Dungeon playset was originally released for the Return Of The Jedi series of toys. This is one of the rare times when action figures were included with the playset (Baraka, Amanaman and EV-9D9).

The version we have is the original one released for Return Of The Jedi, which was later rel-released with a different set of action figures (Klaatu, Nikto and 8D8). The Jabba The Hutt Dungeon playset is nearly identical to the Droid Factory playset Kenner released in the late 1970's for the first Star Wars film.
