The Patrol Dewback was originally sold for the original Star Wars series of toys. It was later reissued after the Return Of The Jedi series of toys had been out for awhile.

We have two copies of the Patrol Dewback, both of which are the reissue version, as well as the original boxes (pictured) in good condition.
