This EV-9D9 droid action figure was first exclusively available in the Jabba The Hutt Dungeon playset. It was later made available seperately in The Power Of The Force series in 1985.

The photo is taken with the droid missing the left arm, but we have the arm (it falls off). Our copy of EV-9D9 is from the Jabba The Hutt Playset.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
