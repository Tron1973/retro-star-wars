The Luke Skywalker action figure was one of the very first
released by Kenner in 1978. At first only available as a mail-in Star Wars Early Bird Kit, included with Chewbacca, Princess Leia and R2-D2. Soon after, Luke became available with many others from the original Star Wars movie, and was also sold individually in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi packaging in subsequent years. The Star Wars Early Bird kit is one of the most rare and collectible Star Wars items ever made, and this Luke Skywalker is not from that set. It is, though, from the original first run of figures produced for the first Star Wars movie.

Just like Darth Vader, out copy of Luke Skywalker had a decapitation incident sometime in the 1980s, likely during a light-saber battle.  However, we did manage to super glue his head back on, as you can see in the photo.
