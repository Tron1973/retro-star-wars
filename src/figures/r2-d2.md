The R2-D2 action figure was one of the very first
released by Kenner in 1978. At first only available as a mail-in Star Wars Early Bird Kit, included with Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Chewbacca. Soon after, R2-D2 became available with many others from the original Star Wars movie, and was also sold individually in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi packaging in subsequent years. The Star Wars Early Bird kit is one of the most rare and collectible Star Wars items ever made, and this R2-D2 is not from that set. It is, though, from the original first run of figures produced for the first Star Wars movie.

We have two copies of R2-D2, one of which is in fair condition and the other in poor condition. R2-D2 and C-3PO are the first two Star Wars figures we ever bought, back in 1978.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
