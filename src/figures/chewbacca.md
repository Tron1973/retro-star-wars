The Chewbacca action figure was one of the very first released by Kenner in 1978. At first only available as a mail-in Star Wars Early Bird Kit, included with Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and R2-D2. Soon after, Chewbacca became available with many others from the original Star Wars movie, and was also sold individually in both The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi packaging in subsequent years. The Star Wars Early Bird kit is one of the most rare and collectible Star Wars items ever made, and this Chewbacca is not from that set. It is, though, from the original first run of figures produced for the first Star Wars movie.

Chewbacca has no visible damage or wear and tear, and is in great condition.
