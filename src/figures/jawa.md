The Jawa action figure, along with Yoda and some of the Ewoks are among the smallest Kenner produced.

We have two copies of the Jawa figure, both of which are in excellent condition. However, neither of our Jawas are from the very first production run where the Jawa had a vinyl cape rather than cloth.  

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
