This Death Star Commander action figure is from The Empire Strikes Back era of figures, not from the very first series when the figure was titled Death Squad Commander. Apparently Death Squad Commander was determined to be an inappropriate name compared to Death Star Commander.

We have two copies of the Death Star Commander figure.
