The C-3PO droid action figure was originally made for the first Star Wars film, and released in 1978.

C-3PO and R2-D2 were the first Star Wars action figures we ever owned, though, having bought them in 1978. We later got another copy of C-3PO, but neither one are the version with removable limbs from The Empire Strikes Back.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
