Baraka was first exclusively available in the Jabba The Hutt Dungeon
playset, and was later packaged seperately under The Power Of The Force line of toys in 1985.

We have two copies of Baraka, one from the Jabba The Hutt Dungeon playset, and the other from The Power Of The Force series.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
