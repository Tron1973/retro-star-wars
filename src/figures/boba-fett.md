This Boba Fett action figure is from The Empire Strikes Back era of Star Wars toys produced by Kenner, from 1980 - 1982.  However, it is not the very rare version of Boba Fett that has a missile that fires from the pack on his back. That version was only produced for a short time, as it was pulled due to fears that small children might choke on the missile...kind of a strange concern given that nearly all Star Wars action figures came with small weapons or accessories that could also be considered choking hazards...

We have two copies of this Boba Fett figure, one of which is in excellent condition (the one pictured) and one that is in fair to poor condition.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
