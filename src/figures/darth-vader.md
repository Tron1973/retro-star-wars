This Darth Vader action figure is from the original run of Kenner action figures produced for the first Star Wars movie. 

Darth Vader is one of two action figures in our collection that suffered a decapitation, during a fierce light-saber battle, no doubt.  We did managed to super-glue his head back on, which you can see in the photo.  The other figure to lose his head? Luke Skywalker, of course.

### All action figures in this collection are loose.
